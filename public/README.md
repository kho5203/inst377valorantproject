# VALORANT AGENT HUB

### Created by: INST377 Group 38 - Andrew Cudd, Gabriel Pasion, Kenneth Ho, Nicholas Bach

Valorant Agent Hub is an interactive site for Valorant players to explore and study the game's agents.
Users can see the stats and abilities of each agent, as well as explore our "Workshop" page to create your own agent!
By simply filling out the form, you too can make your dreams come to life with your very own Valorant agent!
Valorant Agent Hub is mainly targetted for **PC/laptop** browsers, similar to the game itself.
_For legal reasons, this website is not sponsored not affiliated by/with Riot Games. Creating your own character in the Workshop does NOT create a virtual character in the game._

Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md) - 15pts
The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
Your Developer Manual covers:
How to install your application and all dependencies
How to run your application on a server
How to run any tests you have written for your software
The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do
A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
Documentation needs to be written in Markdown (MD) files, nicely formatted
Documentation should be included in each teamâ€™s final code submission.
Documentation should be saved in your main project directory under "docs"
